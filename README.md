# ðŸ“Š Churn Analysis

Data analysis plays a key role in identifying behavioral patterns and supporting strategic decision-making within companies. In subscription-based business models, such as SaaS companies, understanding customer behavior over time is essential for maintaining an active and engaged user base.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

In this case study, the goal is to use **descriptive statistics** and **exploratory data analysis** techniques to investigate a potential increase in the **churn rate** â€” that is, the cancellation of subscriptions by customers. Using a dataset that includes **user profile information** and **platform usage records**, the analyst is expected to validate a hypothesis raised by the team and generate actionable insights for **product and business teams**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

This type of analysis is valuable because it helps:

- Identify trends  
- Raise hypotheses about the causes of customer churn  
- Anticipate actions to reduce user attrition

More than simply confirming whether churn has increased, the challenge lies in **translating data into clear, visual, and actionable insights** â€” supporting decision-making based on **concrete evidence**.
